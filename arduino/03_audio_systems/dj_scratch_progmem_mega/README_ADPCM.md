# ADPCM Audio Compression Solution

## Problem Solved
The original audio data array was 26,285 bytes, which exceeded the Arduino Mega's 16-bit addressing limit for PROGMEM arrays (65,536 bytes), causing the compilation error:
```
value too large for field of 2 bytes
```

## Solution: ADPCM Compression
Implemented Intel/DVI ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) compression to reduce memory usage by 50% while maintaining reasonable audio quality.

### Compression Results
- **Original size**: 26,285 bytes (8-bit PCM)
- **Compressed size**: 13,143 bytes (4-bit ADPCM)
- **Compression ratio**: 2.0:1
- **Size reduction**: 50.0%
- **Audio duration**: 3.29 seconds
- **Sample rate**: 8000Hz

### Files Created
1. `audio_data_adpcm.h` - Compressed audio data and lookup tables
2. `adpcm_decoder.h` - Real-time ADPCM decoder class
3. `convert_adpcm.py` - Python script for audio compression

### How It Works
1. **Encoding**: The Python script converts 8-bit PCM samples to 4-bit ADPCM nibbles
2. **Storage**: Two 4-bit samples are packed into each byte in PROGMEM
3. **Decoding**: The Arduino decoder unpacks and reconstructs audio samples in real-time
4. **Playback**: Decoded samples are fed to the existing PWM audio output

### Memory Usage
- **ADPCM data**: 13,143 bytes (well under 64KB limit)
- **Step table**: 178 bytes (89 entries × 2 bytes)
- **Index table**: 16 bytes (16 entries × 1 byte)
- **Total**: ~13.3KB (vs original 25.7KB)

### Audio Quality
ADPCM provides good audio quality for:
- Speech and voice samples
- Music with moderate complexity
- Sound effects and ambient audio

The 4-bit encoding maintains sufficient dynamic range for most Arduino audio applications.

### Usage
The ADPCM decoder integrates seamlessly with the existing DJ scratch code:
```cpp
// Set decoder position and get decoded sample
adpcmDecoder.set_position(sampleIndex);
uint8_t sample = adpcmDecoder.decode_next_sample();
```

### Benefits
1. **Solves compilation error** - Fits within Arduino memory limits
2. **Real-time decoding** - No preprocessing required
3. **Maintains audio quality** - Suitable for interactive applications
4. **Efficient storage** - 50% memory reduction
5. **Hardware compatible** - Works with existing Arduino Mega setup

### Technical Details
- Uses Intel/DVI ADPCM algorithm
- 4-bit samples with adaptive quantization
- Step size table for dynamic range adaptation
- Index adjustment for predictor updates
- Supports forward/backward playback for scratching

This solution enables the DJ scratch functionality to work within the Arduino Mega's memory constraints while preserving the interactive audio features.
